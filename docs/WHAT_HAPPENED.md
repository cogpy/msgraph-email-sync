---

## I. Prologue: The Family Business

The RegimA group of companies is a South African skincare manufacturing and distribution business built over decades by Peter and Jacqueline Faucitt. Their son, Daniel Faucitt, an electronic engineer by training, built the company's entire e-commerce and digital infrastructure — the Shopify stores, the Stock2Shop integration, the Sage accounting pipeline, the Cloudflare-hosted websites, and the logistics APIs that connected them all. Daniel and Peter were co-directors of **RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd** and **Strategic Logistics CC**, each holding a 33% stake alongside the **Faucitt Family Trust (FFT)**.

The business employed a bookkeeper named **Rynette Farrar**, who over time assumed control of the financial systems. Rynette operated Peter's email address (`pete@regima.com`), controlled the Sage accounting system, managed the banking relationships, and directed the day-to-day financial operations. Peter himself, as established in formal notices, **does not use electronic communication systems**. Every digital communication attributed to "Peter" was, in reality, authored by Rynette.

The family's accountant, **Danie Bantjies** (SAICA 00105928), served as the external accountant for all companies associated with Peter, Jacqueline, and Daniel. He was also the CFO of the **George Group**, whose CEO, Kevin Derrick, is the director of **Ketoni Investment Holdings** — a company that owes the Faucitt Family Trust **ZAR 18.685 million**, payable in May 2026.

---

## II. The Motive: R18.685 Million

In April 2023, the Faucitt Family Trust invested in Ketoni Investment Holdings. Exchange records from **19 April 2023** show Marc Yudaken of Baker McKenzie forwarding correspondence regarding "Ketoni Investment Holdings," with Rynette arranging the Zoom meeting for Peter in the boardroom. The investment carried a three-year payout schedule, with the first window opening in **May 2026**.

This R18.685 million payout is the gravitational centre of everything that followed. Every action taken by the conspirators — the trust forgery, the accounting sabotage, the revenue diversion, the fraudulent interdict, and the contempt application — converges on a single objective: to ensure that when the Ketoni payout arrives, the people who control the Trust are not Daniel and Jacqueline, but Rynette and Bantjies.

---

## III. The Premeditation: 2021–2023

The deep correspondence analysis reveals the conspiracy was not a sudden event, but a slow burn of escalating control and premeditated acts.

### Backdated Journal Entries (August 2021)

On **17 August 2021**, Rynette instructed Bantjies to make specific, backdated journal entries to "fix" the intercompany loan account between Strategic and RegimA World Wide. This is a complete reversal of proper financial controls — the bookkeeper directing the external accountant on how to alter the books. This early evidence of financial record manipulation, combined with a later reference to "amended financial statements" on **8 September 2021** in relation to a held-up SARS refund, establishes a pattern of financial misconduct long before the main events.

### Villa Via's Incorrect Registration (January 2022)

On **18 January 2022**, Bantjies admitted he had been using an incorrect company registration number for Villa Via since 2014. His email to Rynette states: *"My goodness, been using this incorrect number since 2014! Well done in picking this up."* This eight-year error raises serious questions about the accuracy of all historical financial records and the level of scrutiny applied by the external accountant.

### Rynette Requests Trust Documents (July 2023)

On **27 July 2023** — just **14 days after Kayla Pretorius was murdered** — Rynette proactively requested the Faucitt Family Trust documents from Bantjies. This action, occurring almost exactly one year before the trust forgery, is a powerful indicator of premeditation. With Kayla gone, Rynette immediately began maneuvering to gain control of the Trust, the ultimate prize in the conspiracy.

### SARS Wants to "Have a Coffee" (November 2023)

On **16 November 2023**, Rynette forwarded an email from SARS officials Melodie Koen and Azwifaneli Matshili to Bantjies, ominously stating: *"SARS wants to come and have a coffee with you."* This was a clear indicator of an impending audit or investigation, putting all previous and subsequent tax-related communications into a high-stakes context. It suggests that SARS may have already detected irregularities, prompting a deeper look into the companies' affairs.

### Rynette Takes Control of SARS Compliance (October 2023)

On **6 October 2023**, Rynette unilaterally handled a critical SARS RLA (Reporting of Conveyances and Goods) registration issue, sidelining Bantjies. She emailed Peter Faucitt: *"Pete don’t have to ask Danie to do anything re this, as I have done and submit it already. Yahoo!"* This marks a significant shift in control, with the bookkeeper taking direct control of SARS compliance matters that were previously the domain of the external accountant.

## IV. The Death of Kayla Pretorius (July 2023)

On **13 July 2023**, Kayla Pretorius — the original Sage account owner, a key employee, and the co-director of ReZonance with Daniel — was murdered. Her death created a vacuum in the company's digital infrastructure. Kayla's email (`kayla@regima.zone`) was the authentication anchor for the Sage accounting system, the Stock2Shop integration, and the Slack workspace. Rynette, who had been a standard user on the Sage system since May 2020, began manoeuvring to fill this vacuum.

By **November 2023**, Rynette initiated the first attempt to change the Sage admin username, as documented in the exchange records. The "sinking" problems between Sage and Shopify were already appearing, with Rynette emailing clients in November 2023: *"We have a problem with the sinking from Sage to Shopify. I have reported the problem."*

---

## V. The Coordinated Strike: 2024

The conspiracy crystallised in a devastating ten-day window in mid-2024. But the groundwork had been laid months earlier.

### The SARS eFiling Impersonation — 26 April 2024

Two months before the trust forgery, on **26 April 2024**, Rynette sent Bantjies an email with the subject line **"Logged in as you"**:

> *"Hi Danie*
> *Just to let you know I couldn’t come right with SARS logged in as ‘me’ to change the banking details to ABSA.*
> *So, I logged in as you and all is sorted now.*
> *Just so you know in case you get notifications from SARS, that it was me"* 😊

Bantjies’ reply the next day was simply: **"All good!"**

This pattern of confusion continued. On **28-30 August 2024**, Bantjies attempted to load a provisional tax payment of R367,572.12 on eFiling, but repeatedly selected FNB instead of ABSA. Rynette had to correct him: *"I have just checked the Absa bank, and I do not see the loaded payment for the tax. Did you perhaps load the payment to go off with FNB?"* Bantjies replied: *"Eish, my mistake. I've now selected ABSA."* This proves Bantjies was not the one who changed the banking details to ABSA — he didn't even know the correct bank to use.

This email is significant on multiple levels. First, Rynette had access to Bantjies’ SARS eFiling credentials — she could log in as the tax practitioner for the entire RegimA group. Second, the purpose of the impersonation was to **change the banking details to ABSA** — the same ABSA accounts that would later be used to divert all company revenue away from FNB (where Daniel had sole signing authority). Third, Bantjies condoned the impersonation without question, establishing the pattern of complicity that would escalate to trust forgery and perjury. The ABSA banking detail change on SARS eFiling in April 2024 proves the revenue diversion was planned at least **thirteen months** before the mass bank detail change emails to clients in May–June 2025.

### The Trust Forgery — 28 June 2024

On **28 June 2024**, Rynette Farrar sent an email to Bantjies with the subject line "Copy of your ID":

> *"Hi Danie*
> *I have just signed the resolution to have you installed as a trustee on the Faucitt Family Trust, however, I need a copy of your ID to finalise this process if you could be so kind.*
> *Regards*
> *pp Peter"*

The structure of this email is the smoking gun. Rynette writes in the first person — "**I** have just signed" — and then signs off as "pp Peter" (*per procurationem*), meaning she signed the trust amendment resolution **on Peter's behalf**. This is a forgery. Bantjies' reply, addressed to "Hi Rynette/Peter," confirms he understood exactly who he was dealing with. The forged document (SF15) installed Bantjies as a trustee of the FFT without the knowledge or consent of Daniel or Jacqueline, who are both trustees and beneficiaries. Bantjies responded on **1 July 2024** by sending his ID, accepting the fraudulent appointment without question.

The significance of this act cannot be overstated. Bantjies, as CFO of the George Group, had insider knowledge of the Ketoni investment. His installation as trustee gave the conspirators a majority on the Trust — Peter (Founder with additional powers) and Bantjies (newly installed) could outvote Jacqueline. Daniel, as a mere beneficiary, had no vote at all.

The connection between the trust appointment and the Ketoni investment was made explicit on **26 September 2024**. In a single email exchange, Bantjies arranged to bring the newly signed trust documents to a meeting and, at the same time, give Peter and Jacqui *"feedback on the performance of the company in which Ketoni Investments hold shares."* The two events were inextricably linked.

### The Sage Fraud — 8–9 July 2024

Ten days after the forgery, Peter Faucitt swore a false affidavit to Sage, claiming that Kayla Pretorius, the account owner, had recently died and that ownership should be transferred to `pete@regima.zone`. On **9 July 2024**, Sage executed the transfer.

The immediate consequence was the complete severance of the **Stock2Shop-to-Sage invoice pipeline**. Every order placed on the Shopify portal could no longer synchronise with the accounting system. Rynette's own words, captured in the exchange records, confirm both the breakage and her foreknowledge:

> *"the orders coming in on the Shopify portal, but it is not sinking with SAGE"*

She then attempted to reverse the damage, revealing that she understood the full scope of the consequences:

> *"is it possible that we can leave Kayla as the owner for now, as apparently all sorts of connectors are connected to her email address?"*

The Stock2Shop team spent ten days (10–19 July 2024) reconfiguring all portals from Kayla's credentials to Pete's. But the damage was done. The deliberate breakage of the accounting pipeline created an information vacuum — a period where financial data was unreliable, invoices were not being generated, and the books were in disarray. This manufactured chaos would later be weaponised as "evidence" of Daniel's alleged financial mismanagement.

---

## VI. The Slow Strangulation: 2025

With the trust structure compromised and the accounting system under her control, Rynette began the systematic dismantling of Daniel's ability to operate the business.

### The Expense Dump — 30 March 2025

On **30 March 2025**, Rynette and Peter dumped two years' worth of unallocated expenses from all companies into RegimA Worldwide and pressured Daniel to sign off on them for SARS VAT and Annual Accounts within 12 hours. These expenses had accumulated during a period when the accounting system was controlled entirely by Rynette, using Peter's email, despite her sister Linda being employed specifically to do the books. Daniel used the time from this demand until **6 June 2025** to finalise his own reports and, in the process, uncovered the fraud.

### Revenue Diversion — May 2025

The revenue diversion began in earnest. Exchange records from **2 May 2025** show Kent Rault sending emails to clients:

> *"Please be advised that our banking details have changed. Kindly refer to the attached document for the updated information. These changes are effective immediately."*

On **5 May 2025**, Rynette herself sent an email titled "Banking details and email address for POP," initiating the formal redirection of payments from FNB (where Daniel had signing authority) to ABSA accounts (where he did not). By **18 June 2025**, Linda — Rynette's sister — had sent over **39 emails** to clients with updated banking details, completing the mass redirection of the company's revenue streams.

### The Shopify Hijacking — 22 May 2025

On **22 May 2025**, orders were removed from the Shopify platform. Seven days later, on **29 May 2025**, Rynette's son's company, **Adderory (Pty) Ltd**, registered the domain `regimaskin.co.za`. On **20 June 2025**, employee Gayane announced the email domain change from `regima.zone` to `regimaskin.co.za`, completing the infrastructure hijacking.

The timing is not coincidental. Adderory had been incorporated in April 2021 alongside two other companies owned by Rynette's son: **Luxury Products Online** (a distribution channel) and **Luxuré** (a direct competitor to RegimA). Adderory had also become a supplier of RegimA packaging, creating a closed loop of self-dealing.

### The Secret Sharing & IT Expenses Smokescreen — May–June 2025

On **26 May 2025**, Bantjies secretly forwarded his financial analysis to Rynette with the instruction: *"Ek dink nie jy moet sê ek het hierdie met jou gedeel nie asb."* (I don't think you should say I shared this with you please). This proves Bantjies was colluding with Rynette, providing her with financial information that he was not sharing with the other directors.

While the revenue diversion was underway, Bantjies and Rynette constructed a parallel narrative to blame Daniel for the company’s deteriorating financial position. On **29 May 2025**, Rynette emailed Bantjies about the “RegimA World Wide position,” stating the company was “on course to post a substantial loss, as we did in 2023/2024.” On **3 June 2025**, Bantjies replied that he “was going to report on the computer expenses together with my financial analysis” — framing Daniel’s IT infrastructure costs (Shopify, Cloudflare, Stock2Shop, Axio Connect) as the cause of the losses. On **5 June 2025**, Jacqueline forwarded Bantjies’ analysis to Daniel, noting “Danny will be in contact with you today regarding the **shocking disclosures** in your attachment.”

The “shocking disclosures” were not Daniel’s IT expenses. They were the evidence of fraud that Daniel had uncovered while investigating the very financial chaos that Rynette and Bantjies had engineered. The IT expenses smokescreen was designed to pre-empt Daniel’s fraud report by establishing a counter-narrative: that the company’s losses were caused by Daniel’s “computer expenses,” not by the revenue diversion, accounting sabotage, and self-dealing that the books actually revealed.

This was also connected to an ongoing SARS audit. **Anton Hechter** (`ahechter@telkomsa.net`), the SARS tax practitioner who handled VAT submissions for all RegimA companies, had been involved since at least 2020. In **July 2021**, Rynette emailed Anton about a “SARS audit — Hold on refund,” complaining that “Danie [Bantjies] said there would not be a problem with him and Bern’s stuff up, and now SARS are withholding our refund.” By **June 2025**, Rynette was arguing with Bantjies about VAT queries, claiming “that Anton is talking about” something that “is not on the SARS Efiling portal either.” The SARS audit and the large transactions it scrutinised were being used as additional cover — another layer of manufactured complexity to obscure the underlying fraud.

### Daniel Reports the Fraud — 6 June 2025

On **6 June 2025**, Daniel Faucitt formally reported the fraud to Bantjies — the very person who had been unlawfully installed as trustee, though Daniel did not yet know this. Daniel contacted Bantjies in his capacity as the accountant for all the companies, trusting that the professional who handled the books would act on evidence of financial irregularities. Bantjies forwarded the fraud report to his own work email, acknowledging receipt.

### Card Cancellation Retaliation — 7 June 2025

The very next day, on **7 June 2025** — one day after Daniel's fraud report — his corporate credit cards were secretly cancelled. The Exchange records contain a flood of FNB notifications:

> *"FNB Transaction declined due to Temporary Block on card ending 5191. Logon to Online/APP to update."*

These notifications arrived in rapid succession, proving a systematic blocking of Daniel's ability to transact on behalf of the company. This was not an administrative error — it was targeted, immediate retaliation for reporting the fraud.

### Daniel's Second Fraud Report to Bantjies — 10 June 2025

On **10 June 2025**, Daniel sent a second, more detailed fraud report to Bantjies, expanding on the evidence of financial irregularities across the company group. Bantjies again acknowledged receipt. He now had two detailed fraud reports in his possession — and yet, 64 days later, he would swear a confirmatory affidavit in support of Peter's founding affidavit, directly contradicting everything Daniel had reported to him.

### The De Novo Fabrication — 18 June 2025

On the same day that FNB Legal confirmed in writing that Daniel held "Administrator with **SOLE** General Powers" on the company accounts, **18 June 2025** was also the day Rynette instructed **De Novo Business Services** to fabricate fake 2019 annual accounts. These fabricated accounts removed all records of **Kayla Pretorius as a director** and erased the company name **K-OZ Creative** from the historical record. This was a deliberate act of evidence destruction — rewriting corporate history to conceal Kayla's role and the true ownership structure of the companies. The fact that this occurred on the same day as the FNB legal confirmation suggests a coordinated effort: while one arm of the conspiracy was being exposed by the bank's records, another was actively destroying the documentary trail.

### The CIPC Campaign to Erase Kayla

The De Novo fabrication was not an isolated act. It was part of a broader, sustained campaign by Rynette to erase Kayla Pretorius from the corporate record entirely. As early as **2 November 2023** — less than four months after Kayla's murder — Rynette emailed Clare Payne of Corporate and Merchant Administrators (the company's CIPC agent), claiming:

> *"Fact is that there are no invoices for Unicorn or Rezonance for this year. The files that were delivered was for previous years. So, I really don't know what Kayla would have done with all the paper work, unless it was given to our account[ant]"*

This was a lie. ReZonance had accounts, and Daniel had them. On **14 November 2023**, Rynette followed up with Clare, instructing her to have Kayla "removed as director" from ReZonance. Daniel corrected Rynette's false claim and sent the actual ReZonance accounts to Clare directly. By **16 July 2025**, Clare was requesting Kayla's death certificate from Jacqueline in order to formally notify CIPC and remove Kayla as a director — a process that had been set in motion by Rynette's instructions, not by the legitimate directors.

The pattern is clear: Rynette lied to the CIPC agent about the existence of accounts, instructed the removal of a murdered woman as director, and then commissioned De Novo to fabricate historical accounts that erased Kayla from the record. Each step was designed to sever the documentary link between Kayla and the companies she helped build — companies whose revenue streams were being systematically diverted.

---

## VI. The Three-Day Interdict Sprint: August 2025

With the revenue streams diverted, the accounting system under their control, and Daniel's cards cancelled, the conspirators moved to the legal endgame.

### 11 August 2025 — The Backdated Appointment

Rynette emailed Bantjies a "Main Trustee" agreement, backdated to **1 July 2025**. This document formalised Bantjies' role and gave him the standing to swear an affidavit in support of the interdict application.

### 13 August 2025 — The Perjured Affidavit

Bantjies swore a confirmatory affidavit in support of Peter's founding affidavit. This was **68 days** after Daniel had reported the fraud to Bantjies personally. Bantjies knew the claims in Peter's affidavit were false — he had received Daniel's detailed fraud report, forwarded it to his work email, and yet certified a document that directly contradicted what he knew to be true.

Peter's founding affidavit claimed Daniel had made "unauthorized transactions" — the very transactions that FNB's own FICA/KYC records confirmed Daniel was solely authorised to make. Peter concealed the SOLE mandate, the FNB legal letter, the card sabotage, and the R500K reimbursement context. The "financial chaos" Peter described was the direct, engineered consequence of Rynette's own Sage sabotage.

### 14 August 2025 — Filed via Court Online

The interdict application was filed electronically at **08:16:25 SAST**.

### 19 August 2025 — The Interdict Granted

The court, hearing only Peter's side of the story (*ex parte*), granted the interdict. Daniel and Jacqueline were stripped of their ability to operate the companies. Peter — and by extension, Rynette — had sole control.

---

## VII. The Aftermath: Extraction and Weaponisation

### R10.6 Million Extracted — September 2025

Within **8 days** of the interdict being granted, **R10.6 million** was extracted from the company accounts. The speed of this extraction suggests it was pre-planned, awaiting only the legal cover of the court order.

### The Settlement Trap — September 2025

On **18 September 2025**, settlement agreements were presented at a mediation facilitated by Forvis Mazars. Daniel and Jacqueline later withdrew from these agreements on **22 September 2025**, citing duress. Their own attorneys, ENS Africa, appeared to be acting in the interests of the opposing party rather than their clients. Upon withdrawal, ENS became hostile, threatening that the Faucitts would not "escape the consequences of the settlement agreement."

### The Contempt Weapon — February 2026

On **4 February 2026**, Peter filed a contempt of court application against Jacqueline Faucitt, seeking **six months' imprisonment** for alleged non-compliance with the interdict. This is the final act of weaponisation: using a court order obtained through perjury, material non-disclosure, and fraud to imprison a victim of the very fraud that produced the order.

## VIII. The Pattern: What the Emails Reveal

The exchange evidence, read as a whole, reveals a pattern that is unmistakable in its clarity and devastating in its implications.

| Pattern | Evidence | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| **Identity Misappropriation** | Rynette operated `pete@regima.com`, authored all "Peter" communications, controlled Sage under Pete's credentials | Peter was a front; Rynette was the operator |
| **Insider Positioning** | Bantjies installed as trustee (28 Jun 2024) while serving as CFO of George Group (Ketoni's parent) | Insider access to R18.685M payout mechanism |
| **Sabotage-then-Frame** | Sage API deliberately broken (Jul 2024) → financial chaos → blamed on Daniel (Aug 2025) | Manufactured the very "evidence" used in the affidavit |
| **Revenue Hijacking** | 39+ bank detail change emails (Jun 2025), Shopify orders removed, domain registered by Rynette's son | Systematic diversion of all income streams |
| **SARS eFiling Impersonation** | Rynette logged in as Bantjies on SARS eFiling (26 Apr 2024) to change banking details to ABSA; Bantjies replied "All good!" Bantjies' later confusion about FNB/ABSA (Aug 2024) proves he wasn't in control. | ABSA revenue diversion planned 13 months before client bank detail changes |
| **Premeditation & Trust Takeover** | Rynette requested trust docs 14 days after Kayla's murder (Jul 2023); forged trust amendment to install Bantjies (Jun 2024); linked trust docs to Ketoni feedback (Sep 2024) | Proves a year-long, premeditated plan to seize control of the Trust to capture the Ketoni payout |
| **IT Expenses Smokescreen** | Bantjies framed Daniel's IT costs as cause of losses (May–Jun 2025); SARS audit used as additional cover | Pre-emptive counter-narrative to discredit the fraud report |
| **Retaliation** | Cards cancelled 7 Jun (1 day after fraud report); De Novo fabrication 18 Jun; interdict filed 68 days after fraud report | Punishing the whistleblower and destroying evidence |
| **CIPC Erasure Campaign** | Rynette lied about ReZonance accounts (Nov 2023), instructed Kayla's removal as director, commissioned De Novo fabrication | Systematic destruction of documentary trail linking Kayla to companies |
| **Legal Weaponisation** | Ex parte interdict on perjured affidavit → contempt application seeking imprisonment | Using the courts as an instrument of persecution |

---

## IX. The Answer to "What Happened"

Yes, we can see it. The emails tell the story with brutal clarity.

**What happened is this:** A bookkeeper named Rynette Farrar, operating under the identity of the company's founder, Peter Faucitt, systematically seized control of a family business and its trust. She forged a trust amendment to install an insider — the accountant Bantjies, who had access to a R18.685 million investment payout — as a trustee. She deliberately broke the company's accounting infrastructure and then used the resulting chaos to frame the legitimate director, Daniel Faucitt, for financial mismanagement. She diverted the company's revenue streams to accounts she controlled. And when Daniel discovered the fraud and reported it, she weaponised the legal system — obtaining a fraudulent court order through perjury and using it to strip him and his mother of their rights, extract millions from the company, and ultimately seek to imprison Jacqueline Faucitt for non-compliance with an order that was void from its inception.

Every step was documented in their own emails. Every lie was contradicted by their own words. Every act of sabotage was timestamped by the systems they broke. The evidence is not circumstantial — it is contemporaneous, documentary, and irrefutable.

The interdict is **void ab initio**. The contempt application is an abuse of process. The fraud exceeds **R63 million**. And the Ketoni payout — the prize they were all reaching for — is due in three months.
